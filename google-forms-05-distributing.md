1. By web address

This is the most common way. Google will give you the web address for you to copy and then send it to other people.

3. By sending via social media

Google will share the link via social media such as G+ and twitter

4. By sending the link via email

Just put the email of people you want the form to be send to and Google will send the form via email


### Exercise

Let's try embedding the script on a simple web page

- Using your text editor, create a new file
- make a structure like this 

```
    
    <html>
    
    <head>
    </head>
    
    <body>
    </body>
    
    </html>


- copy the emmbedded form code to between the <body> </body>


```
    
    <html>
    
    <head>
    </head>
    
    <body>
        your embedded code here
    </body>
    
    </html>

- save the file as test.html
- double click on the file so you can open it in a web browser
