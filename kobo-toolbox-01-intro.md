### Why mobile data collection ?

Imagine that you are an architect that is doing research regarding modern & traditional buildings.
You have to go to urban and rural places to collect data, take photos & videos, and get the location of the buildings.
You expect to go to the densest of cities and the sparsest of village where there is no internet and no cell phone signal.

We see the keywords : *photos*, *videos* , *location*, *offline*

Remembering the benefit of the mobile data collection vs the web based survey tools [here](google-forms-01-intro.html), we can see that mobile data collection can get that benefits.

- can be used offline & online
- has a dedicated mobile app
- used to get location, photo, and video data

### Example of different kind of mobile data collection
